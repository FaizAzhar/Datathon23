Agriculture comprises a wide range of activities such as farming, forestry, and livestock production, all of which not only supply food and resources to the population but also contribute to the economy in a variety of ways. First, agriculture generates employment opportunities, as it involves multiple sectors, including cultivation, processing, and transportation. An increase in employment opportunities would result in higher levels of goods and services being created, leading to increased production and economic activity. This, in turn, leads to the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by stimulating both the supply and demand sides of the economy. Second, agriculture brings a significant contribution to GDP. This is because, the revenues obtained from the production of crops, livestock, and other agricultural products is counted as part of the countryâ€™s GDP. Furthermore, as technology and modern farming practices have advanced, agriculture has become more efficient, resulting in larger yields and more productive use of resources. This, in turn, leads to an increase of GDP growth, which is critical to a country's economic progress. Hence, realizing the importance of the agriculture sector to economic growth of a country, this study aims to study the relationship between three agricultural aspects which are food, crops and vegetable and fruit production and the primary indicators of economic growth, namely the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)."),
